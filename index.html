        <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/ruby">Ruby</a> is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby.

It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.
